## Projects/Repositories
[ECSE-211: Design Principles & Methods Course Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWQ5Dy_Kga0)
- In a team of 6, designed, assembled, and programmed a robot to deliver the correct fire suppressant cube to three hypothetical fires located on a grid, according to initial user requirements and input
- Utilized a RaspberryPi, various control sensors and motors as well as Lego pieces in the design and build
- Used Breadth-First-Search (BFS) Algorithm, coded in Python, to find the shortest path to the hypothetical fires on the map
- Gained insightful and valuable knowledge in general data structures, shortest path finding algorithms as well as working in a dynamic team setting with constantly evolving requirements

[Chorify](https://github.com/ChrisVatos/chorify)
- Fullstack web application that provides organizational functionality of household chores for families
- SpringBoot backend with a React.js frontend
- JUnit tests for the SpringBoot backend to assure correct functionality

[ECSE-428: Software Engineering in Practice Course Project](https://github.com/JamesDarby345/5LeagueFantasy)
- In a team of 6, created a soccer fantasy web application that allowed users to select players from all 5 major European soccer leagues on a weekly basis
- Set up a head-to-head system where users, with their selected teams of 5 players, would face off and earn points based on the performance of their selected players
- Gained insightful and valuable knowledge in Spring/SpringBoot, database management, React.js, Gherkin testing, and software development best practices working with a large team on a single code base

[Python DSA Course + LeetCode Questions](https://github.com/ChrisVatos/Python_DSA_Course)
- Repository that organizes the lessons, practice questions, and LeetCode examples presented in the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)
- Gained insightful and valuable knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms and provided a nice baseline for subsequent courses and interviews

[Facelift](https://github.com/ChrisVatos/FaceLift)
- Targeted face blur using Python and external libraries to protect the privacy of bystanders during news casts, sport events, etc.
- McGill CodeJam 12 entry

[Museum Manager App](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2022/project-group-07) <br> 
- Fullstack web application that provides varying functionalities to distinct users
- Employed the agile methodology in a team of 6 as part of a semester long school project 
- SpringBoot backend with a vue.js frontend
